**Personality**
Lawful Good
Living with other soldiers so long, all Arvo has earned is a crude sense of humour.
He fights, because he is told to fight (and it's all he's good at). He also finds it important to protect his land and people.
He would happily lay down his life for his friends and those he served with.
He is way too content, and that has proven a boring life. He will obey the law forever.
